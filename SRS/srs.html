    <h1>Web & Android Application</h1>
    <p> <b>The purpose of developing this “Virtual classroom” is to keep the 
students and teachers connected through a virtual platform even when they cannot reach 
to the physical platform.</p>
   
<br>

<h3>Scope</h3>
<p> 
Students can choose courses, attend lectures, take exams, records, progress report as per their convenience.<br>
Attend lectures either at the scheduled time or on request view lecture at a later time.<br>
Faculties can take lectures, upload assignments, announcements, evalute answer sheets and also can upload lectures and other 
discussions in various formats as in video, power point presentation etc.<br>
Upload and Download of various assignments, faculty notices, student's comment, videos.<br>
Real time collaborations among chat rooms, shared and interactive whiteboards.

        <h3><b>Existing System</h3>
        <p>
It’s a limited system and fewer users friendly. <br>
Searching of particular information is critical it takes lot of time.<br>
In the existing system students need to learn course in the class room only.<br>
In the manual system student need bare the lot of time and cost.<br>
The existing system need to travel a location in which one have to participate in 
the course.<br>
Conduct of examination and compilation of result is a tedious process.<br>
The existing system needs to save the information in the form of files.<br>
Limited sharing is possible if the data is in the form of paper or disk drives.<br>
The manual system gives us less security for saving data, some data may be lost 
due to mismanagement.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <h3><b>Proposed System</h3>
        <p>As the virtual classroom is one that aims to give the student an experience equal to or 
better than sort they would find in a traditional classroom. There are obviously many 
advantages of the virtual classroom to the student, as well as the teacher and the 
associated educational institution. 
The system after careful analysis has been identified to be presented with the 
following modules:</p>
        <p>
 Student Registration: Admin can register a student for a specific program.<br>
Video Lectures: Student can watch and listen the class room session repeatedly 
which will be uploaded by the teacher.<br>
Record Storage: The user information files should be stored in centralized 
database which can be maintained by the system<br>
Authentication: Authentication of this application will be provided for only 
registered members.<br>
Activities for Students: The teacher can upload assignments to the students, 
multimedia which a student can download and listen when required.<br>
Administration Access: Administration would be able to keep an eye on the 
records of students.<br>
Library: Student helping material would be available.<br>

of our system are explained below:</center>
<br>
<p>
Users must have valid User ID and password to login thus creating their 
individual profiles.<br>
Administration can register new teachers.<br>
Students can choose courses.<br>
Attend lectures either at the scheduled time or view lecture later.<br>
Video lectures facility can also be available for the students.<br>
Students can check result and assignments.<br>
Faculties can take lectures, upload assignments, announcements, compile results 
and also can upload lectures and other discussions in various formats as in videos, 
power point presentation etc.<br>
Comment Section are available for students regarding any query.<br>
There can be platform to discuss various queries and to put up suggestions posted 
both by students and teachers.<br>
Documents and media library that can help in active learning of a student.<br>
Student can send any application to the administration for any query.<br>

<section class="Advantage" id="Advantage">

<h1 class="heading">Advantages for Students</h1>
<center><b>Advantages for the students are explained below: </center>
<br>
<p>
Time and Cost Saving: For students of virtual classrooms, advantages primarily 
concern access, time, and cost factors compared to those incurred from attending 
physical classroom.<br>
Remove Traveling: Virtual classrooms remove the need of travel to attend the
lectures.<br>
Education at Doorstep: Our system is a platform to provide education at 
doorstep.<br>

</p>

<h1 class="heading">Advantages for Faculty</h1>
<center><b>Advantages for the teachers are explained below:</center>
<br>
<p>
Flexibility for Teacher: For teachers of virtual classrooms, working part-time is 
a possibility because of the flexible nature of the classroom.<br>
Effective Communication: Another advantage to the teacher is that they have 
time to respond to student communications in the virtual classroom, which gives 
the teacher a chance to construct the best possible response to the student. <br>
Independent of Location: The teacher is not required to work from an office or 
classroom to instruct lessons or organize material and lessons this can be done 
from anywhere where they have access to a computer with an Internet connection.<br>
